### Server

- [ ] Debug the watchdog module. It has some weird behavior.
- [ ] Dynamically add files as they are being processed. Current behavior is: process all, then add them at once. This can cause impatience in case of lots of files.
- [ ] Add settings module
- [ ] In case of duplicates, select the higher bitrate track
- [ ] Add and deploy demo branch

### Client
- [ ] Add processes tab to show running tasks, eg. when tagging files. I have no idea on how to go about it so far. Web sockets?
- [ ] Responsiveness, especially the track list.
- [ ] Make dummy buttons functional.
- [ ] Add settings page (or modal)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts listing page (or modal)
- [ ] Add backspace shortcut to go back.
- [ ] Implement Esc key to cancel modals.
